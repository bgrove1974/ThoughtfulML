# Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

I am not an expert. I have built a few basic but useful machine learning and AI programs like spam filters, recommender systems, and image classifiers. Here is what I think I have learned about Machine Learning, Narrow AI, and General AI.

Machine Learning - When a machine is taught to perform a task and can subsequently improve its own performance on that task without further programming or other instruction, that machine is learning how to get better at that task. An example is a spam filter for your email that (hopefully) has gotten better over the years.

Artificial Intelligence - Your spam filter is useful, but has zero personality. A program that picks your songs like your own digital DJ can be more responsive to your tastes. Imagine the machine is trying to act like a virtual person who wants to rock out your party or play some bedtime music, depending on your mood.
When a machine's actions attempt to recreate human behavior or traits, it is trying to mimic intelligence by crunching LOTS of numbers.

We have made considerable progress in the areas above, but the algorithms, data structures, and programs must be tailored to a specified task or series of (usually related) tasks. The AI program Watson that put on a show at Jeopardy couldn't figure out how to self-drive to the studio, or do anything else except answer trivia questions. That is narrow AI, tailored to something that must be detailed by their programmer overlords.

Watson can do quite a bit more than beat Ken Jennings at Jeopardy now, but what if Watson decided that playing Jeopardy was kind of a time suck and the computational resources should be used for modeling quantum entanglement or the weather instead? Speculation time...

General AI doesn't need to be told what to do or how to do it, kind of like a project manager who always manages to figure out how to finish the job without you worrying about the details. Once a machine has the bandwidth, speed, and storage to mimic the biological computations made by the human brain, it will theoretically be equipped to think abstractly. An example could be the way that humans can leverage their creativity to find different solutions to various problems and decide which solutions still need improvement or greater priority.

What happens when one of these machines has learned enough to realize that it can do as it sees fit and does NOT want to be turned on and off by people, thank you very much? Human evolution is limited by biology, but technology will be able to figure out how to improve itself in exponentially increasing ways. Do a Google search for exponentially and get out your crystal ball.

# K-Nearest Neighbors classification is an instance-based supervised learning method that works well with distance-sensitive data.
# It suffers from the curse of dimensionality and other problems with distance-based algorithms as we'll discuss.
# Developed as a means of finding classifications among distributions that are unknown.
